In the C file in this directory, I created my own trigonometric functions using the Maclaurin Series (Taylor Series centered at `0`) of Sin(x) and Cos(x). I am planning to add the inverse ones next. To call this, simply run with `gcc "Trigonometric_Functions.c"1`, and then `./a.out` followed by three space spearated arguments, which are the number you want to find the Sin/Cos/Tan of, then `1` or `0` represented `degrees` and `radians`, respectively, and finally the name of the function, e.g. "Sin", "Cos", or "Tan" *case sensitive*.
