In the C file in this directory, I created my own trigonometric functions using the Maclaurin Series (Taylor Series centered at `0`) of Sin(x) and Cos(x). I am planning to add the inverse ones next. To call this, simply run with `gcc "Trigonometric_Functions.c"`, and then `./a.out ` followed by three space spearated arguments, which are the number you want to find the Sin/Cos/Tan of, then `1` or `0` representing `degrees` and `radians`, respectively, and finally the name of the function you want *case sensitive* with the first character uppercase, and the rest lowercase. For instance, if I want to find `Tan` of `0.5` in degrees, I would do `./a.out 0.5 1 Tan`. 

Also, in addition to those functions, all *crucial* math functions (modulus, power, and factorial) were created from scratch by me. Therefore, the `<math.h>` header file is not really required. The only reason it's really included is because its `Sin`, `Cos`, and `Tan` functions are used as references to compare the answers of my functions to, just to make sure my functions actually work like they should.
